			You do not have to be good. <br>

			You only have to let the soft animal of your body <br>

			If you suddenly and expectadly feel joy, <br>
			don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty <br>
			of lives and whole towns destroyed or about <br>
			to be. We are not wise and not very often <br>
			kind. And much can never be redeemed. </span><br>
